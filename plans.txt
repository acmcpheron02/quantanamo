Overview:

Player must launch off of rotating orbs (see sonic 3 mini game) while collecting charge items. If they reach the top with another charge items, they can quantum tunnel through the security door into the next area. There is a slowly encroaching hazard rising from the bottom that spurs the player forward, and will hurt/kill the player if they land in it.

--Implementation questions

How does the player control the character?
    No grounded state, only stationary on the ground during launch phase
    Airborne players should have a lot of momentum but some level of manual control to aim into various clouds and electrons.
    When in the cloud, players will rotate at a fixed rate with the most momentum being available as they are passing over the center. However they can press left or right to rotate around the sphere to plan their position.
        Optional: Clouds lose power over time? Encourages players not to spend too long aiming.

How is contact with the orb/cloud detected?
    Cloud and players need colliders. (Might be able to steal this from beeg)
    Player needs different state controllers for free fall and cloud attached and launch.
    Yeah, lets go with that.

Alternate: Instead of an electron cloud orbit, what if they are more like slingshots that can be aimed?
    Would be easier to implement, because I can easily understand applying a vector to a player.

How does the animation of traveling around the orb work?
    This math is going to be tricky. Going to need a vector2 at least, I'm wondering though if a vector3 makes sense. That way the value is still stored somewhere for the travel of depth?
    There was a graphic of how pistons can be used to make a circle, maybe there's some inspiration there since I'd be trying to convert 1 dimensional forces to 3d?

How are the levels constructed?
    Ideally automatically generated, but for now I should plan on hand crafted. Will be easier to test other mechanics before expanding outward.
